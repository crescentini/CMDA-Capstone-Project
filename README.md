# CMDA Capstone Project
### The AI'd Powers - Chandler Crescentini, Colin Lagator, Quinn Moore
This repository contains a small collection of our work throughout the Fall 2019 semester on The American Soldier in World War II project with Dr. Ed Gitre from the Virginia Tech Department of History.

More information on this project can be found at https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/tkotwim/the-american-soldier

Included within are the final report, final presentation, and tools and techniques workshop presentation in which I discussed the state-of-the-art publicly accessible language modeling tool, BERT.

## Executive Summary
Throughout World War II, the Army conducted over 200 different surveys covering a variety of topics in order to gain insights into the mind of the “civilian soldier”. Each survey consisted of multiple choice and handwritten response sections. Originally, there was a one-to-one match of these two parts, but over time, this connection was lost. The Army researchers did not have an efficient way to process the large amount of text, so their focus was on the multiple choice responses. Our primary goal was to assist our client, Dr. Gitre in reuniting this data using serial numbers that are associated with some surveys. This process was successful for a subset of the data, but others will need to be developed to reunite the whole collection. In addition, we provided Dr. Gitre with a showcase of different natural language processing (NLP) techniques, including Sentiment Analysis, the CUR Decomposition, and N-grams. These analyses provide insights into the free response data for the first time since it was collected three-quarters of a century ago. The analysis of this data yields a unique and novel look into the minds and humanity of soldiers in World War II.
